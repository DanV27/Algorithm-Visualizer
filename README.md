Algorithm Visualizer
A Python-based visualization tool for sorting algorithms. This project allows users to visualize how sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort work in real-time. The application is built using the pygame library.

Features
--------------------
Sorting Algorithms:
Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort

Interactive Controls:
Highlight sorting order (Ascending/Descending)
Highlight selected sorting algorithm
Reset the list

Dynamic Visualization:
Real-time visualization of sorting steps
Color-coded bars for better understanding

Customizable:
Adjustable list size and range of values

How to Run
----------------------------
Install Python: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Install Dependencies: Install the required library pygame using pip:
Run the Program: Execute the Python script:

Controls
------------
R: Reset the list with random values.
SPACE: Start sorting using the selected algorithm.
A: Set sorting order to Ascending.
D: Set sorting order to Descending.
I: Select Insertion Sort.
B: Select Bubble Sort.

Visualization Details
----------------------------
Bar Colors:
Green: Current bar being compared.
Red: Bar being swapped.

Highlighted Text:
Sorting algorithm and order are dynamically highlighted.
Reset button turns red for 1 second when pressed.
